		<h2 id="chicken">Chicken</h2>
		<p>Blacken the peppers over a gas flame or under the grill, then place in a bowl and cover with clingfilm to steam. After 15 minutes, they should be really easy to peel, so peel off and discard the skin. Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic, then, roughly chop the tomatoes. Halve, deseed and finely slice the chilli, then pick and finely chop the oregano leaves. Heat a little olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and fry for a couple of minutes, then add the garlic, tomatoes, paprika, chilli and most of the oregano. Cook for around 5 minutes, or until starting to soften. Pull the chicken off the bones in chunky pieces, discarding the bones and skin. Add the chicken to the pan with the stock. Tear the peppers into chunky strips, add to the pan and stir well. Leave to bubble away for 25 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced and is thick and glossy.Place the fennel seeds into a pestle and mortar and bash until crushed.

		<h2 id="beef">Beef</h2>
		<p>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Lightly grease a large roasting tray.Peel and coarsely grate the potato, then add to a bowl with the minced pork and beef. Scrunch and mix together, then use wet hands to roll the mixture into balls, slightly larger than a golf ball – you should end up with 21 altogether. Reserving 3 to one side, place the meatballs into the prepared roasting tray, then set aside. To make the gravy, peel and finely chop the onions, trim and finely chop the fennel, then add to a large pan over a medium heat with a good splash of oil. Cook for 10 minutes, or until softened.

		<h2 id="sushi">Sushi</h2>
		<p>Put the rice in a small saucepan with 375ml water, leave to soak for 30 minutes, then bring to the boil. Put the lid on and simmer gently for 10 minutes, until the water has been absorbed by the rice. In a bowl, dissolve the sugar in the vinegar, then sprinkle over the rice mix, combining with a rubber spatula so as not to break up the rice. Allow to cool for 20 minutes before using. Deseed or peel the vegetables, then cut into fine strips or batons.Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat, then spread half the rice over the sheet except for 1cm clear at the top. Add some vegetables in a horizontal line across the rice. Begin rolling the mat from the near edge, keeping the filling in place with your fingers. Roll firmly but not too hard.
